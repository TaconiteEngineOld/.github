# TeaEngine
Tea engine is a game engine being wrote in nelua with a custom system that should give better performance, it is focused on ease of use for the user without creating a cluttered a user interface.
* **Modular** to allow only the things you require to be a part of your build and ease of use
* **Simple** use for the end user, allowing them to worry less about the engine and more about what they are doing.
* **Smaller scope** than game engines as Unity, this means you won't get distracted by the amount of tools, leading to faster and more productive. If there are too many tools you *may* get distracted by them or they may even get in your way.
* **Focused** on what you *need* to make a game, if you don't need it, and it doesn't have a good, well thought out purpose it is not there.
